<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As many of you may know, Netflix recently debuted 5. season of the Formula 1 documentary series, 'F1: Drive to Survive', on February 24th. With the start of the new season just a few days away, the first Grand Prix set to kick off in Bahrain on March 5th, the wait is almost over!

With this exciting new season on the horizon, I've taken it upon myself to create a data exploration repository, where we can delve into the history of Formula 1 and uncover some of the most interesting and intriguing facts about this incredible sport. By analyzing data and statistics from past seasons, we can gain a deeper understanding of the drivers, teams, and races that have made Formula 1 the thrilling and unpredictable spectacle that it is today. 

Get ready for an exciting new year of Formula 1 discussions! Whether you're a die-hard fan or just getting into the sport, I'm sure you'll find something that catches your attention in here!

Use the `main.ipynb` to get started.
